Which of the implementations uses more memory? Explain why.					
The linked list uses significantly more memory, because of all the pointers					
					
Which of the implementations is the fastest? Explain why.					
Linked lists are slightly faster at lower numbers, but in higher numbers 					
the dynamic array becomes faster, I think they generally iterate at the same speed					
					
Would you expect anything to change if the loop performed remove() instead of contains()? If so, what?					
I would expect remove to perform faster with a linked list because the dynamic array has to copy the rest					
of the array from the spot you move a value out of, whereas a linked list doesn't have to do this.
